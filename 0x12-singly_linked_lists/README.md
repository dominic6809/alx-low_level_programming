C - Singly linked lists

A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.

Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a data field as well as 'next' field, which points to the next node in line of nodes. Operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include insertion, deletion and traversal.

TASKS
0. Print list
mandatory
Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

Prototype: size_t print_list(const list_t *h);
Return: the number of nodes
Format: see example
If str is NULL, print [0] (nil)
You are allowed to use printf

1. List length
mandatory
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

Prototype: size_t list_len(const list_t *h);

2. Add node
mandatory
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

Prototype: list_t *add_node(list_t **head, const char *str);
Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed
str needs to be duplicated
You are allowed to use strdup

3. Add node at the end
mandatory
Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.

Prototype: list_t *add_node_end(list_t **head, const char *str);
Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed
str needs to be duplicated
You are allowed to use strdup

4. Free list
mandatory
Write a function that frees a list_t list.

Prototype: void free_list(list_t *head);
